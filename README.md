# Bank-System

## Bank Management System â€“ Python, OOP
Developed a console-based banking system using Python and object-oriented principles. Implemented multiple account types (Savings, Current, and General) with unique features like minimum balance checks and overdraft protection. Improved code modularity by designing class hierarchies for account types, enabling scalable and reusable structure.

## Bank System is a small python project base on OOP concept. So in Bank system has these classes and there works:
1. Bank ; This class is the collection of accounts and work for adding new account, removing an account and finding an account in the bank account list.

2. account ; This is a class which make a new bank account with there unique account number, bank holder name and some initial balance and It works for deposit money in an account, withdraw money if bank balance is sufficient for this deducts and get information for there account balance.

3. Savings Account ; This is also an account in which same attributes and methods are present similar like account class with addition on a new attribute 'Interest rate' and a new method 'add interest' .

4. Current Account ; Basically this is also an account which has an overdraft limit so that you couldn't cross your exceed amount above the overdraft limit.
